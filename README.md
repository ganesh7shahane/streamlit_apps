# SAR Analyser 🧬
A modern, object-oriented Streamlit application for Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) analysis in drug discovery. Built with RDKit, this tool provides a point-and-click interface for common cheminformatics workflows, eliminating the need to write repetitive Jupyter notebooks for each project.

# 🎯 Overview
SAR Analyser transforms molecular data analysis from a coding task into an interactive experience. Whether you're analyzing scaffolds, clustering compounds, or predicting ADMET properties, this application provides professional-grade tools through an intuitive web interface.

Built for: Medicinal chemists, computational chemists, and drug discovery scientists who want to focus on insights rather than code.
