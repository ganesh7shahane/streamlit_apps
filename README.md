As I worked on numerous drug discovery projects, I came to realise it is not the best use of time to code or write the same jupyter notebooks for similar analyses across different drug discovery projects. 
As a result, I am putting this repo to build simple GUI around popular cheminformatics tools I regularly use, so that all analysis will be a point-and-click affair.
